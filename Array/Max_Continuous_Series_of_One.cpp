// You are given with an array of 1s and 0s. And you are given with an integer M, 
// which signifies number of flips allowed.
// Find the position of zeros which when flipped will produce maximum
// continuous series of 1s.
//
// For this problem, return the indices of maximum continuous series of 1s in order.
